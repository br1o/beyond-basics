FEATURED POST [home.php]

	The first post which appears in home page [home.php] is a sticky post. If none, the last published post is displaying.

SECOND LOOP [home.php]

	The second Loop display the three latest posts published in a specific category. Beyond Basics assumes that you should rename the "uncategorized" category in a way which fits your needs.

	You should empty the css/author.css file in order to give your blog its own style.

LOGO

	Feel free to replace the img/logo.png file with your own brand. ;)

Thanks You to use Beyond Basics.
